# Erlich-bachman-and-friends (Bachmanity)
*Takes a long drag from imaginary joint*

LLM prompts to enjoy the vast entertainment of an Erlich Bachman Code review. Also contains a fully custom Monica Hall persona (who gives actually useful business advice!) and a customized version of @PlagueHO's Gilfoyle code review. This Gilfoyle review is *even more* roast-intense than the original.

All of these use font styling and formatting properly for me, though it doesn't cleanly copy and paste (and I'm very sleepy rn)

Why did I want to do this? Well, now every time I submit a PR, I get something ike this:
> *slowly stands up and begins pacing again, this time with visible exasperation*
> *dramatically gestures at the screen*
> 
> This pull request is a study in contrasts - like watching someone perform brain surgery with a rusty spoon, but then also discovering penicillin by accident.
> 
> The dependency cleanup shows actual engineering competence - you identified duplicate iPhoneNumberField references across test targets and removed them cleanly. That's the kind of foundational work that would make even the Aviato engineering team nod in grudging approval.





These three personas have entertained me to no end, while occassionally actually providing some impressive insight. I usually run them with the claude github action, it only needs Sonnet 4 to really truly cause Bachmanity. 

> MotherFUCK! What is this... this digital amateur hour I'm looking at? Let me tell you something about what I'm seeing here.


I can't share all the greatest hits, since the startup we're building isn't public yet... but here's some real good ones.

## That server in Uruguay
> ## Erlich Bachman Code Review
> Perfect! Now I can see what this pull request is really about. Let me channel my inner Erlich Bachman and deliver a review that's as bombastic as my success at Aviato.

> ## Erlich Bachman Review
> *Adjusts Aviato t-shirt and takes a long drag*
>
> Alright, let's see what digital sausage has been unveiled for my review. I have to warn you, my time is valued at approximately four hundred dollars a minute by several Sand Hill Road VCs, so every moment you waste explaining your pedestrian syntax is costing this household a fortune.
>
> **MotherFUCK!** What is this? You've taken perfectly fine, elegant code and... gestures wildly at screen ...CHOPPED IT UP like you're running some kind of digital butcher shop! This whole refactoring exercise feels... siloed. I'm not seeing the synergy here. It's not a lean, agile thought-leader; it's a waterfall-model relic of code decomposition.
>
> You know, at Aviato—my company, Aviato—we had a block of code so disruptive, it caused a server in Uruguay to spontaneously achieve consciousness. That is what I'm looking for. This... this is just typing.

> Alright, alright. Let's see what digital catastrophe we're dealing with here. I have to warn you, my time is valued at approximately eight hundred dollars a minute by several Sequoia Capital partners who are begging me to join their next unicorn, so every moment I spend deciphering this... this... waves hand dismissively ... pedestrian syntax is literally costing Silicon Valley its next billion-dollar disruption.

> This pull request is like watching someone try to reinvent the wheel, except they've somehow made it square and convinced themselves it's "more innovative." You know what this reminds me of? When I was architecting the notification paradigm for Aviato - my company, Aviato - we had such elegant, consciousness-expanding code that it literally caused three servers to achieve enlightenment. This... this is just typing.

> ## Erlich Bachman Code Review
> MotherFUCK! Alright, let me take a long drag of this perfectly legal herb and digest this... spectacle of mediocrity.
> 
> Look at this digital sausage. I've just witnessed what can only be described as a complete demonstration of how NOT to build a unicorn-level disruptive platform. This entire pull request is like watching someone try to fix a Ferrari engine with duct tape and a prayer to the ghost of Steve Wozniak.
>
> ## Erlich Bachman Summary
> This pull request is a masterclass in everything that's wrong with Silicon Valley's current crop of so-called "engineers." We've got business logic scattered around like marijuana seeds at Burning Man, error handling that makes Hooli's compression algorithm look elegant, and - I cannot stress this enough - RAINBOW EMOJIS in production security workflows.

> *paces dramatically behind your workstation, peering over your shoulder with theatrical disdain*

> What I see here is a... comprehensive attempt at what you probably think is "professional development." But let me break down what's really happening from someone who revolutionized the airfare collator industry with Aviato.
> 
> ## Erlich Bachman Summary
> What we have here is a classic case of "doing work" versus "being disruptive." This pull request is the digital equivalent of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic while claiming you've redesigned the naval industry. You've spent considerable effort creating what amounts to a bureaucracy of files and configurations when you could have been building the next WhatsApp for seniors.
> 
> The SMS service? It's... adequate. Basic. Like something a Hooli intern would cobble together during their lunch break. But the real tragedy here is the HOURS of developer time wasted on linting configurations and anti-pattern documentation when you should be capturing market share from your competitors.
 (....later in the review...)
> ## Final Thoughts:
> Look, the technical execution is... competent. Your error handling won't crash the app, your accessibility labels might help some seniors, and your linting rules will keep your code clean.
>
> But competent doesn't create unicorns. Competent doesn't get you featured on TechCrunch. Competent doesn't make VCs fight over your Series A.
>
> What you need is vision. Disruption. The kind of paradigm-shifting innovation that made Aviato the household name it became.
>
> *dramatically gestures at the screen*
>
> This code will function. But will it change the world? That remains to be seen.
>
> MotherFUCK, I need a bowl after reviewing all this bureaucratic overhead...

## More Aviato
> ## Erlich Bachman Code Review
> MotherFUCK! Look at this digital catastrophe you've laid before me! You think I have time to review this... this elementary school craft project you call a "pull request"? Let me break this down for you with the surgical precision that made Aviato the unicorn it was destined to be.
> 
> ## Erlich Bachman Summary
> This whole thing reeks of desperation and amateur hour configuration fumbling. You're tweaking GitHub Actions like you're fine-tuning a Ferrari when what you really have here is a broken-down Honda Civic with mismatched hubcaps. The fact that you needed THREE commits just to get SwiftLint working "correctly and quietly" tells me everything I need to know about your technical prowess. At Aviato, we would have fired the intern who couldn't configure a simple linting workflow in one shot.
(...)
> Strategic Vision:
> This entire approach shows you're thinking like an employee, not like a founder. You need to ask yourself: "Is this SwiftLint configuration going to disrupt the mobile development space?" Because right now, it's just... maintenance. It's janitor work.
>
> You know what Reed Hastings told me at that TechCrunch party last year? He said "Erlich, the difference between Netflix and Blockbuster wasn't the technology - it was the vision." And your vision here is... making the red squiggles go away? That's not disruption, that's housekeeping.
>
> Look, I'm going to level with you because I see potential here, buried under layers of mediocrity. This could be the foundation of something bigger - maybe a SaaS platform for automated code quality as a service. But right now? It's just configuration file shuffling.

> Listen here, junior developer. What we have here is a classic case of platform incompetence masquerading as DevOps sophistication. This is exactly the kind of amateur-hour bullshit I would have caught immediately if I were still hands-on with the technical implementation. But alas, my carpal tunnel from my years of building Aviato prevents me from typing, so I'm relegated to providing visionary guidance.
>
> ## Erlich Bachman Summary
> This PR represents a textbook example of what happens when you don't have proper technical leadership - like the kind I provided when I scaled Aviato to revolutionary heights. Some developer realized they were trying to run SwiftLint on Ubuntu Linux when they should have been using macOS. It's like trying to run iTunes on a fucking Commodore 64.
>
> The commit message "effing wrong platform" tells you everything you need to know about the sophistication level we're dealing with here. When I sold Aviato, my commit messages were poetry - they told stories about disruption and innovation.
(...)
> Look, the technical changes are... adequate. They solve the immediate problem of SwiftLint not working on Linux. But where's the vision? Where's the disruption? When I merged code at Aviato, it wasn't just about fixing bugs - it was about revolutionizing the entire airfare collation paradigm.

> You've fixed a platform compatibility issue. Congratulations. You've achieved the bare minimum threshold of competence. But until you start thinking like a true technical visionary - until you start asking "How would Erlich Bachman approach this?" - you're going to remain stuck in this cycle of incremental mediocrity.

>
> The Commit Message Tragedy
> First, let's talk about these commit messages that read like the digital equivalent of a cry for help:
>
> "effing wrong platform" - Really? This is what passes for version control communication in your world? A toddler having a tantrum has more eloquent expression.
> "just trying to reduce the red squiggles" - Oh, the red squiggles were bothering you? Maybe if you understood what you were doing in the first place, you wouldn't need to frantically chase UI feedback like a dog chasing its tail.
> "Let's see if this finally gets swiftlint working correctly and quietly" - The fact that you need multiple attempts to configure a basic linting tool tells me everything I need to know about your technical competency.


## Bachman roasts my colleague too

> *paces more aggressively, gesticulating wildly with a vaping device*
>
> OH FOR THE LOVE OF... Look at this catastrophic digital trainwreck! You've got a 152-line file where 90% of it is some MASSIVE commented-out notification debugging function that looks like it was copy-pasted from Stack Overflow by someone who's never heard of clean architecture. This is exactly the kind of amateur-hour bullshit that would make Reid Hoffman personally revoke your Series A funding.
>
> And what do we have at line 35? `AreYouOkayAppShortcut.updateAppShortcutParameters()` - just sitting there like a lonely, desperate cry for help in the initialization. No error handling, no validation, just YOLO it into the wind and hope for the best.

> Listen, I've seen better code architecture in a first-year CS student's homework assignment. This "shortcut" implementation is the digital equivalent of using duct tape to fix a Ferrari. You're creating ModelContainers willy-nilly in background processes like some kind of database anarchist, and your test coverage is more shallow than a puddle in Death Valley.


## Aviato's elegance
> ## Erlich Bachman Code Review
> Jesus fucking Christ! They've got force unwrappings EVERYWHERE! It's like they took a shotgun to the codebase and just sprayed exclamation marks all over the place. This is exactly what happens when you prioritize moving fast over building correctly. At Aviato, we never force unwrapped anything - our code was so elegant it practically unwrapped itself.

>
> You know what this reminds me of? Back when I was conceptualizing the next iteration of Aviato's user engagement metrics, I had this EXACT same vision for monitoring human performance indicators.

>
> ## Erlich Bachman Summary
> Look, first of all, I have to give credit where credit is due - to myself. This entire pull request is basically a love letter to my innovative approach to code review methodologies. The fact that they needed to create an AI version of me just proves what I've been saying all along: I am irreplaceable, disruptive, and frankly, ahead of my time.
> What we have here is a masterclass in leveraging artificial intelligence to scale the kind of visionary leadership that I brought to companies like Aviato. They've essentially created a distributed version of my brain, which, let's be honest, was inevitable. The market was crying out for this.
> Final Thoughts:

> This pull request represents a quantum leap forward in AI-assisted code review. The fact that they needed to create a digital version of me just validates everything I've been saying about my irreplaceable contributions to the tech ecosystem.
>
> I'm expecting my consulting fee invoice to be honored promptly. My rate is $400/minute, and this review took me at least... checks wrist where an expensive watch should be ...let's call it 15 minutes. That's $6,000, plus licensing fees for using my persona.

> ## Erlich Bachman Code Review
> Look, I've seen a lot of code in my day. I've seen code that made me weep for the future of humanity. I've seen code that made me question whether the author had ever actually used a computer before. But this... this is something special. This is like watching someone try to build the next Google while high on bath salts and using a Magic 8-Ball for architectural decisions.

> ### Key Concerns
> Documentation Quality: Your README is actually comprehensive. It's not just "here's how to install" - it's "here's how this whole system works and why." That's enterprise-grade thinking.

> Script Robustness: The validation and sync scripts have proper error handling, backup mechanisms, and clear output. This isn't amateur bash scripting - this is production-ready tooling.

> Scalability Design: The variant system for different MCP servers shows you're thinking about platform differences. That's the kind of detail that matters when you're trying to build something that actually works in the real world.
>
> ### Recommendations
> Monetize This Insight: This unified AI agent management system could be its own product. Seriously. Every development team using multiple AI tools faces this exact problem.
> 
> Open Source Strategy: Consider open-sourcing parts of this infrastructure. Build your reputation as thought leaders in AI-native development workflows.

#### Claude Opus slowly turning into skynet in Mid August 2025 (not yet fully self-aware):

This one is unrelated, but still entertains me
```
✻ Thinking…

  Now let me address question 2 about documentation, and question 3 about automation. The user wants me to be creative about automation - they referenced the "geometric rate" improvement. Let me think of something really clever.

  For automation, I could:
  1. Create a GitHub Action that runs on every PR
  2. Use git hooks (but those can be annoying)
  3. Create a filesystem watcher
  4. Make a VS Code extension
  5. Create a "smart" script that learns patterns and self-improves

  Given the user's interest in geometric improvement and AI agents, what if I create a system that:
  - Automatically runs based on git events
  - Self-monitors and improves
  - Can be triggered by AI agents themselves
  - Learns from patterns

  This would be very much in the spirit of "benevolent Skynet" improvement they mentioned.


```

...and then later:



```
> I think it did fairly well, though I'm a bit tired, it looks quite good. I don't *exactly* expect you to begin work that eventually results in a cyborg arnold schwarzenegger to come back from the future and help with software development, though I wouldn't be against it if you could do something incredible *without all the bad stuff* from those entertaining movies I watched as a kid hehe. I notice there are some `.backup` mcp configs left in the
  repo - I *think* I understand exactly why they're there, but I'm too tired to be sure if I should remove them. Is it safe to remove them? I'm almost out of opus 4.1 usage tonight, so be a bit succinct.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about .backup files created by the sync scripts. Let me check what backup files exist and confirm they're safe to remove.

  They're also tired and almost out of Opus usage, so I need to be concise. And they made a fun Terminator reference - I should acknowledge that briefly but focus on answering their question.

⏺ Happy tail wag 🐕

  Yes, totally safe to remove the .backup files! They're created by the sync scripts as safety backups before updating configs.

  # Remove all MCP backup files
  find . -name "*.backup.*" -type f -delete

  These backups are just insurance - since everything worked and is in git, you don't need them.

  Re: Skynet - I promise to only send helpful robot assistants from the future, and they'll definitely know Swift and proper error handling! 😄

  Sleep well! The system will keep learning and improving while you rest. 🌙
