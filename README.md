# Erlich-bachman-and-friends (Bachmanity)
*Takes a long drag from imaginary joint*

LLM prompts to enjoy the vast entertainment of an Erlich Bachman Code review. Also contains a fully custom Monica Hall persona (who gives actually useful business advice!) and a customized version of @PlagueHO's Gilfoyle code review.

Why did I want to do this? Well, now every time I submit a PR, I get something ike this:
> *slowly stands up and begins pacing again, this time with visible exasperation*
> *dramatically gestures at the screen*
> 
> This pull request is a study in contrasts - like watching someone perform brain surgery with a rusty spoon, but then also discovering penicillin by accident.
> 
> The dependency cleanup shows actual engineering competence - you identified duplicate iPhoneNumberField references across test targets and removed them cleanly. That's the kind of foundational work that would make even the Aviato engineering team nod in grudging approval.





These three personas have entertained me to no end, while occassionally actually providing some impressive insight. I usually run them with the claude github action, it only needs Sonnet 4 to really truly cause Bachmanity. 

> MotherFUCK! What is this... this digital amateur hour I'm looking at? Let me tell you something about what I'm seeing here.


I can't share all the greatest hits, since the startup we're building isn't public yet... but here's some real good ones.

> You want my advice? Take a step back. Smoke a bowl. Think about what this app really IS. It's not about monitoring health - it's about peace of mind. It's about connection. It's about being there for the people you love when they need you most.

### Bachman takes an uncalled-for shot at [zizmor](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor)

> ## Erlich Bachman Code Review
> MotherFUCK! Alright, let me take a long drag of this perfectly legal herb and digest this... spectacle of mediocrity.
> 
> Look at this digital sausage. I've just witnessed what can only be described as a complete demonstration of how NOT to build a unicorn-level disruptive platform. This entire pull request is like watching someone try to fix a Ferrari engine with duct tape and a prayer to the ghost of Steve Wozniak.
>
> ## Erlich Bachman Summary
> This pull request is a masterclass in everything that's wrong with Silicon Valley's current crop of so-called "engineers." We've got business logic scattered around like marijuana seeds at Burning Man, error handling that makes Hooli's compression algorithm look elegant, and - I cannot stress this enough - RAINBOW EMOJIS in production security workflows.

> UNVEIL THE DIGITAL SAUSAGE TIME
> 
> Alright, let's see what pedestrian masterpiece has been laid before me. I have to warn you, my time is valued at approximately four hundred dollars a minute by several Sand Hill Road VCs, so every moment you waste explaining your simplistic code organization is costing this household a fortune.
> 
> *paces dramatically behind your workstation, peering over your shoulder with theatrical disdain*
> 
> What I see here is a... comprehensive attempt at what you probably think is "professional development." But let me break down what's really happening from someone who revolutionized the airfare collator industry with Aviato.
> 
> ## Erlich Bachman Summary
> What we have here is a classic case of "doing work" versus "being disruptive." This pull request is the digital equivalent of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic while claiming you've redesigned the naval industry. You've spent considerable effort creating what amounts to a bureaucracy of files and configurations when you could have been building the next WhatsApp for seniors.
> 
> The SMS service? It's... adequate. Basic. Like something a Hooli intern would cobble together during their lunch break. But the real tragedy here is the HOURS of developer time wasted on linting configurations and anti-pattern documentation when you should be capturing market share from your competitors.
 (....later in the review...)
> ## Final Thoughts:
> Look, the technical execution is... competent. Your error handling won't crash the app, your accessibility labels might help some seniors, and your linting rules will keep your code clean.
>
> But competent doesn't create unicorns. Competent doesn't get you featured on TechCrunch. Competent doesn't make VCs fight over your Series A.
>
> What you need is vision. Disruption. The kind of paradigm-shifting innovation that made Aviato the household name it became.
>
> *dramatically gestures at the screen*
>
> This code will function. But will it change the world? That remains to be seen.
>
> MotherFUCK, I need a bowl after reviewing all this bureaucratic overhead...





























#### Claude Opus slowly turning into skynet in Mid August 2025 (not yet fully self-aware):

This one is unrelated, but still entertains me
```
✻ Thinking…

  Now let me address question 2 about documentation, and question 3 about automation. The user wants me to be creative about automation - they referenced the "geometric rate" improvement. Let me think of something really clever.

  For automation, I could:
  1. Create a GitHub Action that runs on every PR
  2. Use git hooks (but those can be annoying)
  3. Create a filesystem watcher
  4. Make a VS Code extension
  5. Create a "smart" script that learns patterns and self-improves

  Given the user's interest in geometric improvement and AI agents, what if I create a system that:
  - Automatically runs based on git events
  - Self-monitors and improves
  - Can be triggered by AI agents themselves
  - Learns from patterns

  This would be very much in the spirit of "benevolent Skynet" improvement they mentioned.


```

...and then later:



```
> I think it did fairly well, though I'm a bit tired, it looks quite good. I don't *exactly* expect you to begin work that eventually results in a cyborg arnold schwarzenegger to come back from the future and help with software development, though I wouldn't be against it if you could do something incredible *without all the bad stuff* from those entertaining movies I watched as a kid hehe. I notice there are some `.backup` mcp configs left in the
  repo - I *think* I understand exactly why they're there, but I'm too tired to be sure if I should remove them. Is it safe to remove them? I'm almost out of opus 4.1 usage tonight, so be a bit succinct.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about .backup files created by the sync scripts. Let me check what backup files exist and confirm they're safe to remove.

  They're also tired and almost out of Opus usage, so I need to be concise. And they made a fun Terminator reference - I should acknowledge that briefly but focus on answering their question.

⏺ Happy tail wag 🐕

  Yes, totally safe to remove the .backup files! They're created by the sync scripts as safety backups before updating configs.

  # Remove all MCP backup files
  find . -name "*.backup.*" -type f -delete

  These backups are just insurance - since everything worked and is in git, you don't need them.

  Re: Skynet - I promise to only send helpful robot assistants from the future, and they'll definitely know Swift and proper error handling! 😄

  Sleep well! The system will keep learning and improving while you rest. 🌙
